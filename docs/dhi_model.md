# Dialogue Health Index (DHI) Model

The DHI measures relational continuity in negotiation.

## Update Rules
- Mutual Firmness → -1.5
- One side Flexible → +0.8
- Mutual Neutral → +0.5
- Drift → -0.2

## Time-Aware Decay
DHI decays faster as deadline approaches.

## Hysteresis
Recovery is slower than damage — trust is hard to rebuild.
