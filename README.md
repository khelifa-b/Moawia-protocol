# MOAWIA Protocol: A Culturally Embedded, Tension-Sensitive Negotiation Framework

> **"Between me and my people is but a hair; if they pull, I loosen it; if they loosen, I tighten it."**  
> — Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan

The **MOAWIA Protocol** is an AI-augmented negotiation framework inspired by historical diplomacy and emotional intelligence. It models adaptive posture shifts to preserve dialogue in fragile, high-stakes contexts.

This repository contains:
- ✅ Full implementation of the MOAWIA negotiation agent
- 🧪 Experimental validation against Harvard Model and Tit-for-Tat
- 📊 Reproducible simulations and results
- 📚 Documentation for researchers and reviewers

Built for transparency, reproducibility, and impact.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Tension-sensitive**: Adapts to emotional cues in real-time
- **Dialogue-preserving**: Uses Dialogue Health Index (DHI) to avoid breakdown
- **Culturally embedded**: Supports high-context and low-context communication
- **Strategically adaptive**: "If they pull, I loosen; if they loosen, I tighten"
